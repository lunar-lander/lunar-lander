## üîç Overview

Lunar Lander is a desktop application that enables seamless interaction with multiple Large Language Models simultaneously. Designed for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts, it allows you to:

- **Compare responses** from different models to the same prompt
- **Create collaborative discussions** where models build on each other's thoughts
- **Customize interaction patterns** with flexible conversation modes
- **Manage your favorite models** with an intuitive configuration system

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Multi-LLM Support

- Connect to any OpenAI API-compatible provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- Configure models with custom endpoints, API keys, and parameters
- Toggle models on/off during conversations with live updates

### Revolutionary Conversation Modes

- **One-to-Many**: Send one message to multiple LLMs simultaneously
- **Many-to-Many**: Each LLM sees all previous responses
- **Round Robin**: Models respond in sequence, with each building on previous responses
- **Custom Mode**: Define specialized semantic configurations

### Advanced Conversation Controls

- Select which LLMs participate in each conversation
- Toggle message visibility for more focused discussions
- Adjust temperature and other parameters per conversation
- Real-time streaming responses from multiple models simultaneously

### Thoughtful UI/UX

- Clean, intuitive interface for managing complex interactions
- Light/dark themes with customizable colors
- Conversation summaries and organization
- Markdown support in messages
- Exportable conversation history

## üß© Conversation Modes Explained

### One-to-Many Mode

- Send a single message to multiple models simultaneously
- Each model responds independently
- Perfect for comparing raw model capabilities on the same inputs
- Models cannot influence each other

### Many-to-Many Mode

- All participants see all messages
- Models can reference and build upon each other's responses
- Creates a collaborative multi-model conversation

### Round Robin Mode

- Models respond in sequence to user messages
- Each model sees the user's message and all previous model responses
- Creates a chain of thought with each model building on previous responses
- Produces a cumulative, collaborative response sequence

### Custom Mode

- Define specialized conversation rules
- Configure which models can see which messages
- Create unique interaction patterns

## üîó Connect Your LLMs

Lunar Lander works with any OpenAI API-compatible service:

1. Go to Settings > Models
2. Add your model with:
   - Name: A display name for the model
   - Base URL: The API endpoint
   - Model Name: The specific model identifier
   - API Key: Your authentication key
