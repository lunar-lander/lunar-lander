## üîç Overview

ChatAAP is a desktop application that enables seamless interaction with multiple Large Language Models simultaneously. Designed for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts, it allows you to:

- **Compare responses** from different models to the same prompt
- **Create collaborative discussions** where models build on each other's thoughts
- **Customize interaction patterns** with flexible conversation modes
- **Manage your favorite models** with an intuitive configuration system

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Multi-LLM Support
- Connect to any OpenAI API-compatible provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- Configure models with custom endpoints, API keys, and parameters
- Toggle models on/off during conversations with live updates

### Revolutionary Conversation Modes
- **Isolated Mode**: Each LLM can only see its own chat history with the user
- **Discussion Mode**: All LLMs see all messages and can reference each other
- **Round Robin**: Models respond sequentially, with each seeing previous responses
- **Custom Mode**: Define specialized semantic configurations

### Advanced Conversation Controls
- Select which LLMs participate in each conversation
- Toggle message visibility for more focused discussions
- Adjust temperature and other parameters per conversation
- Real-time streaming responses from multiple models simultaneously

### Thoughtful UI/UX
- Clean, intuitive interface for managing complex interactions
- Light/dark themes with customizable colors
- Conversation summaries and organization
- Markdown support in messages
- Exportable conversation history

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Download

### Build From Source

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Yarn package manager

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chataap.git
cd chataap

# Install dependencies
make install

# Start the development server
make dev
```

#### Build & Package
```bash

## üíª Development

### Technology Stack
- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **React**: UI library for component-based development
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for better code quality
- **CSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling
- **Webpack**: Module bundling

### Architecture
ChatAAP follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Main Process (Electron Backend)
- Configuration management
- Model management and API connections
- IPC handlers for communication with renderer

#### Renderer Process (Frontend UI)
- React-based user interface
- Context-based state management
- Component-specific hooks and services

## üß© Conversation Modes Explained

### Isolated Mode
- Each model only sees messages between itself and the user
- Perfect for comparing raw model capabilities on the same inputs
- Models cannot influence each other

### Discussion Mode
- All participants see all messages
- Models can reference and build upon each other's responses
- Creates a collaborative multi-model conversation

### Round Robin Mode
- Models respond in sequence to user messages
- Each model sees the user's message and all previous model responses
- Creates a chain of thought across multiple models

### Custom Mode
- Define specialized conversation rules
- Configure which models can see which messages
- Create unique interaction patterns
